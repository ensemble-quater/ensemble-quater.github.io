We are an ensemble focused on contemporary and experimentelle music. 
Shaghayegh, Carlota, Liga und Rita have been playing together for many years in the ensemble ColLab Cologne while studying Master Neue Musik Ensemble Praxis at the HfMT Köln with prof. Susanne Blumenthal where they won the Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy Hochschulwettbewerb  der Sonderpreis für die beste Interpretation des Werkes, worked closely with electronics, sound explorations and with numerous composers, such as Rebecca Saunders or Helmut Lachenmann while performing in Moers festival, Michael von Biel Festival, Klavier-Festival Ruhr, Acht Brücken among others.

Quater is the result of a pursuit in developing our own creative space, developing projects that mirror our values and interests. To have an ensemble that actively searches to make connections between cultures and that takes social responsibility to get away from growing hate and fear in society. 

Being political and influential about something is a luxury not many get to have, but we wish to work towards creating a safe, informed, critical creative space that works side by side with composers and other art forms in exploring how to contribute meaningfully to society.
